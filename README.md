## About this game

This is a cameroonian card game that is to be played with at least three players to make the experience enjoyable.
The players all place a bet at the start of the game and the winner takes it all.

### Rules

- The only cards available are the cards from 3 to 10 of every suit/color.
- Cards are dealt first in a batch of 3 cards per player, then in a second batch of two cards.
- A first player is chosen randomly and he can play any card of his choice from his personal deck. He has what is called the lead.
- The other players are obligated to play a card from the same suit if they have it in their deck. If they don't, they can play whatever they want. Once every player have placed their card, the lead goes to the player whose card had the highest value for the indicated suit.
- The other rounds follow the same principle with the lead player always playing the first card. The game ends when every player has emptied their deck.

### Winning conditions

There are two major ways to win at this game:
- The sum of your cards is lower than 25
- You have the lead at the end of the game.
    - There is however a little trick to double the gains, by keeping the lead in the last with a card of value 3 which is the lowest, it's called a <b>corat</b>
